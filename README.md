# Content Intelligence

Generalized content intelligence pipeline for turning unstructured instructional
artifacts into analysis-ready information objects, searchable corpora, and
source-grounded analytical reports.

Primary artifact: an AI-readable analysis method pack for turning instructional
information objects into source-grounded reports.

This repository is intended to demonstrate the public-safe version of a private workflow originally developed around transcript/corpus construction and analytical reporting. The public version must use sanitized, synthetic, or public-license source material.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Unstructured text processing
- Transcript or corpus construction
- Media-to-transcript ingestion
- LLM-assisted transcript enrichment
- OCR cleanup and document-to-corpus ingestion
- Content extraction
- Source-grounded analysis
- Analysis-ready information objects
- AI-assisted analytical workflows
- Task-specific report generation
- Reproducible pipeline design

## Featured Workflow

The core project pattern is:

```text
instructional artifacts
-> source manifest records
-> normalized artifacts
-> corpus segments
-> evidence citations
-> report briefs / agent-ready context
```

See `docs/information-object-model.md` for the object model and `schemas/` for
public-safe JSON examples.

For a diagrammed walkthrough, see `docs/workflow-diagram.md`.

## Primary Artifact

The canonical artifact is `sample_outputs/analysis-method-pack.json`: an
AI-readable method pack that tells an agent or algorithm how to consume the
information objects, cite evidence, preserve uncertainty, and avoid private
source leakage.

The source method pack lives in `method_pack/` with human-readable companions:

- `method_pack/reporting-rules.md`
- `method_pack/source-use-policy.md`
- `method_pack/example-context.md`

## Reviewer Path

This repository is designed to be reviewed quickly before running anything.

1. Inspect `sample_outputs/analysis-method-pack.json` to see the final
   AI-readable method contract.
2. Read `docs/workflow-diagram.md` to understand how raw instructional artifacts
   become reusable information objects.
3. Read `docs/transcript-enrichment-workflow.md` to see the public-safe version
   of the raw-transcript-to-clean-transcript enrichment pass.
4. Run `make portfolio-demo` to rebuild the demo artifacts and validate the
   generated objects.
5. Inspect `sample_outputs/report-brief.json` and
   `sample_outputs/information-object-map.json` to see the structured reporting
   output and object inventory.

## What To Inspect First

- `sample_outputs/analysis-method-pack.json`: AI-readable reporting method contract.
- `docs/information-object-model.md`: the reusable object model.
- `docs/using-information-objects.md`: how algorithms, reports, and agents use the objects.
- `docs/completion-rubric.md`: the portfolio-ready completion criteria.
- `docs/workflow-diagram.md`: the artifact-to-analysis workflow diagram.
- `docs/transcript-enrichment-workflow.md`: the simulated OpenAI-style transcript cleanup workflow.
- `sample_outputs/information-object-map.json`: object counts across all demos.
- `sample_outputs/report-brief.json`: structured report output with cited evidence.
- `sample_outputs/cloud_video_transcription/transcript_enrichment_brief.md`: transcript enrichment summary.
- `demos/cloud_video_transcription/`: staged media-to-corpus simulation.
- `demos/ocr_document_cleanup/`: OCR cleanup-to-corpus simulation.

### Cloud Video-to-Corpus Ingestion

`docs/cloud-video-transcription-workflow.md` documents a public-safe version of
a real workflow for turning cloud-hosted instructional videos into cleaned,
searchable transcript artifacts. The demo uses synthetic filenames and sample
text, but preserves the transferable engineering pattern:

```text
cloud video inventory
-> media selection
-> temporary private download
-> audio chunking
-> transcription
-> transcript cleanup / enrichment
-> manifest and corpus-ready artifacts
```

Run the synthetic demo:

```bash
python3 demos/cloud_video_transcription/run_demo.py
```

The demo also writes public-safe enrichment artifacts that simulate an
OpenAI-style cleanup pass without making a network request:

- `sample_outputs/cloud_video_transcription/transcript_enrichment_brief.md`
- `sample_outputs/cloud_video_transcription/enrichment_packets/*.json`

### OCR Notes-to-Corpus Cleanup

`demos/ocr_document_cleanup/` demonstrates the adjacent workflow for turning
OCR text from document images into cleaned, citation-ready corpus records.

```bash
python3 demos/ocr_document_cleanup/run_demo.py
```

Build the full object map:

```bash
make portfolio-demo
```

## Quick Demo

The current scaffold is offline and standard-library only.

```bash
make demo
make search QUERY="feedback rubric evidence"
make validate
make portfolio-demo
```

If `make` is unavailable, run the same steps directly:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_manifest.py
python3 scripts/build_corpus.py
python3 scripts/generate_report.py
python3 scripts/search_corpus.py "feedback rubric evidence"
python3 scripts/build_analysis_method_pack.py
python3 scripts/validate_information_objects.py
```

The demo builds:

- `data/processed/manifest.json`
- `data/processed/corpus.json`
- `sample_outputs/demo-report.md`
- `sample_outputs/report-brief.json`
- `sample_outputs/analysis-method-pack.json`

Generated outputs are reproducible and intentionally ignored where appropriate.
The committed sources use synthetic public-safe notes only.

## Public Safety Rules

Do not publish professor names, university course identifiers, private LMS links, copyrighted transcripts, raw lecture text, video URLs, private lecture manifests, or coursework-specific prompts.

Public examples should use synthetic transcripts or public-domain/public-license documents with clear source attribution.

## Portfolio Framing

This project should emphasize the transferable pipeline: ingest, normalize,
segment, retrieve, cite, and report. The value is converting messy instructional
artifacts into reusable information objects, not the private course context.

## Status

Portfolio-ready public scaffold implemented with synthetic input data, manifest
creation, corpus segmentation, staged media and OCR demos, transparent keyword
retrieval, simulated transcript enrichment, source-grounded reporting, an
AI-readable method pack, and validation for generated information objects.
